# Privacy Policy for GBBSS

**Effective Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 22, 2025

At GBBSS, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information. GBBSS is a mobile application designed to support school communication and provide secure access to academic results for members of our educational community in Ethiopia.

This policy applies solely to the GBBSS mobile application and does not cover other school systems or websites, which may have their own privacy policies. By using the app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

When you use the GBBSS app, we collect only the following personal information directly from you:

- Full name  
- Email address  
- Password (created during registration)  
- School-issued ID (used to access academic results)
- Student name (used to access academic results)

We do not collect location data, IP addresses, device details, or browsing behavior. Guest users can browse public posts without providing personal information, and we do not collect any identifying data from them.

---

## 2. Why We Collect This Information

We collect the minimum information necessary to:

- Provide secure access to your account  
- Verify your permissions to post news or manage student records  
- Allow you to view your academic results using your school-issued ID and name 
- Enable interaction with posts (e.g., liking or commenting)  
- Support password recovery when needed  

We do not share your personal information with advertisers. We may share data only with trusted service providers (e.g., cloud hosting services) who are contractually obligated to protect it, with school administrators to enable app functionality, or as required by law.

## 3. Guest Access

You may use the app as a guest without creating an account. Guest users can view public posts and announcements but cannot post, comment, or like. These features are available only to registered users.

---

## 4. Access Levels and User Permissions

GBBSS uses an internal approval system to assign users one of three roles based on school-granted permissions, verified through the “Get Access” feature in the app’s settings. The roles are:

- **Standard Users**: Can register, view public posts, and interact by liking or commenting. They cannot publish news or access student academic records.  
- **Staff Users (News Publishers)**: Authorized by the school (e.g., student residents or communicators) to create and publish official updates. They cannot view or modify student results.  
- **Super Users**: Typically teachers or school staff, authorized to publish posts and update existing student results.  

When you tap “Get Access,” the app checks your email against the school’s approved list. If approved, you’ll receive a confirmation of your access level. If not, the app will notify you that you do not have the required permissions.

## 5. Academic Result Access and Editing

Academic results are managed through a separate school system on staff-operated computers. In GBBSS:

- Students can view their results using their full name and school-issued ID.  
- Super Users, as approved by the school, may update existing records when necessary.  
- **No users can create new student records through the app**.  
- All access to results is secured and granted solely by the school.

## 6. Account Features and Data Retention

As a registered user, you can:

- Sign up using your name, email address, and password  
- Log in securely  
- Reset your password if forgotten  
- Log out of your account  

We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. Account deletion is not currently available through the app. To request deletion of your data, please contact us (see Section 10). We will process verified deletion requests within 30 days, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

---

## 7. How We Protect Your Information

We protect your personal information, including passwords, using industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256) and secure storage practices. Access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized school personnel, and we regularly review our security measures to ensure your data remains safe.

We comply with *Ethiopia’s Data Protection and Privacy Proclamation No. 1321/2024* and other applicable laws to safeguard your information.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

GBBSS is intended for use by individuals aged **13 and above**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may browse public posts in guest mode but must not create an account or submit any personal information.

If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13 without appropriate consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information.

If you believe we have collected data from a child without proper consent, please contact us (see Section 10) for immediate resolution.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. We may notify users of significant changes via email or in-app notifications. By continuing to use the app, you agree to the revised terms.
